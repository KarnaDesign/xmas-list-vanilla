# XMAS-LIST-VANILLA

A Christmas wishlist made in JavaScript, without additional libraries. 
The idea of this demo is to make the same application in vanilla JavaScript, jQuery and React as I am learning to use es6 and beyond.

## HOW TO RUN IT

Start off by cloning this repository.

Run `npm install`.

Run `npm run build`.

Open index.html in the build directory to launch the page.
